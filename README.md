# movie_nodes
This simple example explores relationships of moves by their titles - at **random**!

This is a simple hack-up to explore movies/shows that contain the same word in their title. using the [OMDB Api](http://omdbapi.com/), the script pulls in the 10 next-to-kin movies and makes a force directed graph.

You can also click the node to go to the IMDB page for the movie (you can run into some incredibly obscure movies this way...)
It starts out with an arbitrary word (in this case **mile**), a nice to do would be to add a text box for a starting search of your choice.

Bonus points if you can get to "Terminator 2" from the starting point. Good luck!
